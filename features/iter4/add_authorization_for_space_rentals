Feature: Add authorization for space rental requests

  As a community member
  So I can easily find only my own rental requests
  I want to only be able to see requests I made
  
Background:
  Given I am an DELETE authenticated user
  And I have requested some place at some time
  And some person has requested some place at some time

Scenario: Only see my own requests
  When I am on the DELETE space rental requests page
  Then I should see my own request
  And I should not see some person's request
  
Scenario: Can't edit another person's request
  When I go the some persons' request page
  Then I should be on the space rental request page
